# Weather Prediction Using ESP8266 And DHT11
This project uses an ESP8266 chip and a DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor to collect data about the weather. The data is then sent to predict function of a trained machine learning model to predict the weather. The project also includes ThingSpeak platform that allows users for real-time data visualization of temperature, humidity, heat index and predicted weather.
